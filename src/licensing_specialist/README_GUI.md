This package includes a simple Tkinter GUI for managing trainees, recruiters, classes, exams, and licenses.

Usage
-----

- Run the GUI with:

```bash
python -m licensing_specialist
```

- On first run the SQLite database `licensing.db` is created next to the project root.
- Enter recruiters, trainees, create classes, link trainees to classes, record exams, and record license application/approval dates.

Notes
-----
- Dates are entered as `YYYY-MM-DD` in the simple UI.
- This is a minimal example meant as a starting point; feel free to extend validation, reporting, and export features.
